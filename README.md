# Flair Payment Integration Flow

## Overview

This document outlines the integration flow between the New Flair Website, the Flair Payment Gateway, and the Payment Processor for handling reservations and payments securely. Each component plays a unique role in processing payment information while ensuring data security and seamless user experience.

---

### 1. New Flair Website (Request)

- **Purpose**: The entry point for the reservation and payment flow. Captures user inputs, such as reservation details and payment information, to initiate the process.
- **Action**: When a user submits their information, the website sends a request to the Flair Payment Gateway with all relevant data formatted according to the `ReservationPaymentTransaction API` requirements.
- **Role**: Acts as the starting point, initiating communication with the Flair Payment Gateway.

### 2. Flair Payment Gateway (Token, Decrypt, Rule, Encrypt, Post)

- **Purpose**: Serves as middleware to handle sensitive data and communicate securely with the Payment Processor.
- **Steps**:
  - **Token**: Tokenizes card information to replace raw details with a secure token, ensuring data security.
  - **Decrypt**: If necessary, decrypts data from the website to access details needed for processing.
  - **Rule**: Applies rules for fraud detection, transaction limits, and validations (e.g., checks based on location or card type).
  - **Encrypt**: Re-encrypts sensitive data before forwarding to the Payment Processor.
  - **Post**: Sends a secure API request to the Payment Processor with the transaction data.

### 3. Payment Processor (Process, Post)

- **Purpose**: Processes payments by working with banks or financial networks to authorize and complete the transaction.
- **Steps**:
  - **Process**: Authorizes and completes the transaction by verifying payment method, funds availability, and security (such as 3DS authentication). Approves or denies the transaction.
  - **Post**: Sends a response to the Flair Payment Gateway, indicating success, failure, or any errors.

---

### 4. Flair Payment Gateway (Decrypt, Record, Post)

- **Purpose**: Finalizes the flow by handling the response from the Payment Processor.
- **Steps**:
  - **Decrypt**: Decrypts the processor's response to access the transaction outcome and related details.
  - **Record**: Logs the transaction status and details for auditing and tracking.
  - **Post**: Sends the final transaction status back to the New Flair Website for user notification.

---

### 5. New Flair Website (Receive)

- **Purpose**: Completes the process by receiving the transaction result from the Flair Payment Gateway.
- **Action**: Based on the transaction outcome, either confirms the reservation to the user or displays an error/retry option if unsuccessful.
- **Role**: Closes the loop by delivering the result to the user.

---

## Summary

This integration flow ensures:

- **Secure Handling of Sensitive Data**: Tokenization, encryption, and decryption steps ensure data security throughout the process.
- **Seamless Communication**: Each component effectively communicates with the next to complete the transaction flow.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Responses and statuses are recorded and returned to the website, allowing for user-friendly error handling.
